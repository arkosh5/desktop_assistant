Welcome to the Desktop Assistant!

This is a simple desktop assistant that helps users to perform various tasks such as opening applications, sending emails, and searching the web.

To use the assistant, simply run the code and say your command and the assistant will respond accordingly. Some examples of commands include:

    "Open Google Maps"
    "Send an email"
    "What time is it now?"

The assistant is constantly learning and improving, so if you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thank you for using the Desktop Assistant!
